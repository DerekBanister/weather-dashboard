# Weather Dashboard

* This application is your very own weatherman. Based on your search of a city, this application will display the current day's weather, as well as a 5 day forecast of the weather ahead. Along with that information comes the temperature, wind speed, humidity, the UV index with color codes, and a weather icon displaying the weather in picture format. Along with the previously stated functionality, this application also saves your searches and displays them in a easy to navigate format where you can repeat searches without any extra work besides a click. Whether you are preparing for travel or just a day trip, this application will fill your needs.
